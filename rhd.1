.SH NAME
rhd - a simple utility for dumping a file in hex
.SH SYNOPSIS
rhd [options] [file1] ... [fileN]
.SH DESCRIPTION
rhd is a simple utility for dumping the contents of files in hex. If no files are specified it dumps the contents of stdin. 

The output of rhd looks like:

.ad c
00000000: 23 20 4d 61  6b 65 66 69 | # Makefi |
.br
00000008: 6c 65 20 66  6f 72 20 68 | le for h |
.br
00000010: 64 0a 23 20  24 49 64 3a | d.# $Id: |
.br
.ad l

The first column lists the starting offset of the characters displayed on that line. This is followed by a dump of the hex values of the characters. Finally the ASCII representation of the hex values is displayed. Unprintable characters are displayed as periods (.).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-c [chars]
Dumps [chars] characters per line. The default is 16 characters.
.TP
.B \-s [offset]
Starts the dump at offset [offset] in the file. By default rhd starts at the beginning of the file (offset 0). If [offset] is greater than the length of the file, no dump is produced. 
.TP
.B \-e [offset]
End the dump at offset [offset] in the file. The default behavior is to dump the entire file. If [offset] is greater than the length of the file, dumping stops at the end of the file. This option and the -l option are mutually exclusive.
.TP
.B \-l [len]
Dumps [len] bytes. The default behavior is to dump the entire file. If [len] is greater than the length of the file, dumping stops at the end of the file. This option and the -e option are mutually exclusive.
.TP
.B \-v
Displays the version
.TP
.B \-h
Displays a help message
.TP
.B \-A
No ASCII - Prevents the output of the printable ascii string at the end of each line of the dump.
.TP
.B \-O
No Offset - Prevents the output of the file offset information at the beginning of every line.
